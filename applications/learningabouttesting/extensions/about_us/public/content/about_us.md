<p>Learning About Testing portal is an experiment for knowledge sharing about software testing. We are not a common learning portal, here we'll share you with what we've learned during the years, with: content of real projects, hands-on sessions recorded in hangouts, conversations about software architecture, tools and good practices, and so on.</p>
