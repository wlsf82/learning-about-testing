Learning About Testing Portal

This project is for the building of a learning portal in software testing.
It will have integration with the blog www.talkingabouttesting.com and will also have the following sections in the MVP: Home, About us, Media (with Videos, Podcasts, Images, eBooks and articles), News and Contact.
In a futere vesion it will enable integration with other blogs related to software testing and it will enable the community to submit material (all kind) to be published into the portal (this material needs to be approved). The portal will also have multi-language support. And in the long term it will have a hands-on section, like Codecademy.com.

Learning About Testing Portal project uses Choko (choke.org).

This app uses Node.js in the server side, so it needs to be installed in order to work.

Also, it uses MonboDB database, also required for the project.

The end to end (e2e) tests are made with protractor.
