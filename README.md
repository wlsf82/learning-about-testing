Learning About Testing Portal

This project is about a learning portal in software testing.
The learning about testing portal will delivery free-content for learning eXtreme programming practices very frequently.
It will have integration with the www.talkingabouttesting.com blog and it will also have the following sections (in the MVP): Home, About us, Media (with Videos, Podcasts, eBooks and articles and Images), News and Contact.
In a futere vesion it will enable integration with other blogs related to software testing and it will enable the community to submit material (all kind) to be published into the portal (this material will need to be approved). The portal will also have multi-language support. In the long run it will have a hands-on section, like Codecademy.com.

This project is powered by Choko (choke.org).

This app uses Node.js in the server side, so it needs to be installed in order to work.
Also, it requires MonboDB database.
And the end to end (e2e) tests are made with protractor (http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/).
